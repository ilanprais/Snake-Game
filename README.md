# Simple Snake Game
## overview
In this project, I wrote a simple snake game in python, using the *pyGame* module.

The snake game runs on a 500 by 500 window, and includes feautues such as:
- Apple eating
- Snake size increasing when eating apples
- Score counter
- Game ending when snake runs into itself

## Game Flow
the game is played using the up, down, right, and left arrow keys.

simply control the snake's direction using these keys and play along
